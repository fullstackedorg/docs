# Using npm Packages

The editor supports the use of packages (node_modules). You can install pacakges directly from a git repository or hosted on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com). Use the prompt to install packages. Simply use the `npm install` or `npm i` command.

## Installing packages from npmjs

The default behaviour of the `install` command is to install from npmjs. 

```
npm i react
```

Specifying a version is also allowed.

```
npm i react@18 react-dom@18
```

## Installing packages from a git repository

Use the `http` clone url to install from a git repository.

```
npm i https://github.com/fullstackedorg/ui.git
```

Lock to a commit, a branch or none. If none, it will always install the latest commit of the default branch.

Locking to a commit

```
npm i https://github.com/fullstackedorg/ui.git#d322cb4fb7f572023e4c2031d2106f68bcacb6ea
```

Locking to a branch

```
npm i https://github.com/fullstackedorg/ui.git#dev
```

## package.json and lock.json

After every installation of new package, your `package.json` will be updated with this newly added package plus itâ€™s version. You can always edit this file to add, remove packages or modify the versions.

On the other hand, the `lock.json` file is generated after a successful installation process. **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE**. It makes sure that all the dependencies your project needs, direct or inderect, are locked to assure the build goes smoothly. Plus, it speeds up fresh installations significantly. Before every project run, FullStacked will check with the `lock.json` if all dependencies are installed before trying to bundle and launch the project.
