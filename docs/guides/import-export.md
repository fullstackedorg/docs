# Import/Export a Project

Once you've built an app inside FullStacked, you can export it from your device and import it onto any other device. This way, your web app really runs everywhere.

To export, click the export button in the top right corner of the Project view.

This will generate a `.zip` of your project. Transfer this to your other device.

To import, create a new project and click the import button.

Give some time to FullStacked to unzip and once ready you'll be back in the Project view, ready to run your project!
