# Import/Export a Project

You can always export a project from your device and import it onto another device.

To export, click the export button in the top right corner of the Project view.

This will generate a `.zip` of your project. Transfer this to the other device.

To import, create a new project and select the `Import zip` option.

Give some time to FullStacked to unzip and once ready you'll be back in the Project view, ready to run your project!
