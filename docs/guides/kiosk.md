# Running in Kiosk

Platform supporting the kiosk mode:
- Linux (both GTK and Qt)
- Windows

To directly run a project in fullscreen, use the `--kiosk` flag.

Beforehand, the project needs to have been build at least once through the FullStacked Editor. Then, take not of the project id and use it the command line next to the `--kiosk` flag.

## Linux

```
fullstacked --kiosk org.fullstacked.demo
```

## Windows

```
