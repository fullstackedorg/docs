# Building in VS Code

For some large scale projects, especially if you have other services as dependencies, it can be more handy to work in Visual Studio Code to enable heavier IDE features. For that purpose, there is an installable npm package that mimic the FullStacked environment and allows you to develop outside of FullStacked while reliably knowing your project will run in FullStacked.

To do so, run `fullstacked` with `npx`
```
npx fullstacked
```
