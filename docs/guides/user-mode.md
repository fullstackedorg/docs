# User Mode

For non-developer users who just wants to use FullStacked as the runtime of projects, the user mode is very handy to hide any developer related elements from them. Access it from the settings view.

Projects start directly from the project list view now.

## Commits build

If the project uses `git`, after every successful build, FullStacked will take note of the current commit and won’t rebuild until a new `commit` comes in. Meaning the next project launches will be greatly faster.
