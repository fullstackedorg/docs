# License

FullStacked is licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/fullstackedorg/fullstacked/blob/main/LICENSE), but the Editor is under [GPL-3](https://github.com/fullstackedorg/editor/blob/main/LICENSE).

Which means:

* You can build projects with **FullStacked** as a dependency and redistribute that said project the way you want. (MIT)

* If you use any part of the **FullStacked Editor**, you need to keep the same GPL-3 license, which forces you to open-source the code. (GPL-3)

It is made this way since the main FullStacked packaged app is essentially **FullStacked Editor**, but that does not limit you to build freely with it.
